## FileUploaderSolution

### General:

**- This project was created to complete a test task for a Reenbit.**

**- Among the technologies used to write the application are Angular 16 and ASP.NET Core 7.**

**-The solution was created by implementing the principles of OOP, SOLID, and Clean Architecture.**

**- The Azure platform was used for deployment, specifically App Services and Azure functions.** 

**- More details about each part of the solution can be found in the corresponding sections.**

### Client side:

**- The client side is implemented as a simple application based on the Angular framework.**

**- A page with a upload form, client-side validation, and form submission by clicking a button were performed.**

### Server side:

**- The server side was implemented as an ASP.NET Core Web-API.**

**- On this layer, the controller, service configurations and other settings were implemented directly, as well as the solution to CORS issues.**

### Core:

**- This layer implements the main logic of the application: services, service contracts, the Domain layer, DTOs, and other important parts of the application that implement or participate in the implementation of its main logic.**

### Infrastructure:

**- In the current implementation, this layer does not have specific functionality, as at this stage the application does not have a Data layer. However, this layer can be useful when expanding the application and its functionality.**

### Unit tests:

**- This part of the solution is dedicated to testing the backend logic: the controllers and the services.**

**- Implemented using libraries such as xUnit, Moq, AutoFixture, and Fluent Assertions.**
